# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2023. 

Every crate contains unit tests that work at all times, however I do not
make sure that the code is clean or easily switchable between parts one
and two of every problem.

## Progress

| Problem | Part I | Part II |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1: Trebuchet?! | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Day 2: Cube Conundrum | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Day 3: Gear Ratios | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Day 4: Scratchcards | ❌ | ❌ |
| Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer | ❌ | ❌ |
| Day 6: Wait For It | ❌ | ❌ |
| Day 7: Camel Cards | ❌ | ❌ |
| Day 8: Haunted Wasteland | ❌ | ❌ |
| Day 9: Mirage Maintenance | ❌ | ❌ |
| Day 10: Pipe Maze | ❌ | ❌ |
