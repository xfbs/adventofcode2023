# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2023. 

## Running

Every crate contains unit tests that work at all times, however I do not
make sure that the code is clean or easily switchable between parts one
and two of every problem.

You can run the unit tests simply by running this in the repository root:

```
cargo test
```
