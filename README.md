# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2023. 

I'm publishing this code to allow you to compare your solution to mine. The

## Running

Every crate contains unit tests that work. However I do not make sure that the
code is clean, or easily switchable between parts one and two of every problem.

You can run the unit tests with Cargo by running this in the repository root:

```
cargo test
```

You can run individual solutions by telling Cargo to build and run the crate:

```
cargo run -p day01
```

Usually, every solution requires some input which is passed on standard input.
